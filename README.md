### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm JoaquÃ­n Caro

I'm a software engineer with a focus on building tools and solutions that enhance efficiency and automation. I work with various technologies, including **Rust** and **Clojure**. Notable projects include **goku**, an HTTP load testing tool in **Rust**, and **adh-rust**, a Docker helper.

ðŸ’» I'm passionate about observability, metrics, and distributed systems, always seeking to learn and contribute to open-source projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's collaborate on something awesome!
